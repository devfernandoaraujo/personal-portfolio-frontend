                I am a passionate and creative problem-solve software engineer specialized in web development arena. For the lest few years, I have been
                developing enterprise and portal applications to solve issues related to financial market using C# programming language.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am hands on in all stages of software development cycle, from planning to deployment. Every day is different on my routine; my tasks may
                involve analysis algorithms, altering code, fixing bugs, brainstorming ideas or integrating new systems.
              </p>
              <p>
                The most passionate thing I love in software development is the opportunity to work with people from a wide range of disciplines. The software
                development lifecycle involves working with so many different people and departments and, as someone who loves to build new relationships, itâ€™s
                great to be able to come together with other professionals who are striving towards the same goal.
              </p>
              <p>
                I love to practice sports and meet new people in my spare time. Some activities I am passionate about are running, volleyball and handball.
                During the winter season, I spend most of my time reading self-improvement books and challenging myself to learn new technologies.
